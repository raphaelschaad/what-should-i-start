      <p>All three areas should be iterated on almost in parallel. Although everyone's situation is different, of course, the contemporary business advice is first to identify a desire that people or companies have. Demonstrating a customer-validated prototype that satisfies such a desire in their daily lives turns an idea into a project worth investing in.</p>
      <p>Second, test whether a viable business case exists: Are customers willing to pay for the value you create? Is this price higher than your cost of creating that value? The same way that validating customer demand requires a prototype, testing the productâ€™s value relies on building whatever is needed to provide <em>some</em> version of the envisioned experience.</p>
      <p>The final step is to check how feasible the actual implementation is. For many standard products and services, it is less about <em>whether</em> it is possible and more <em>how</em> it can be done. In the case of new technological frontiers, though, or projects spinning off from fundamental research, the entire order might be turned on its head.</p>
